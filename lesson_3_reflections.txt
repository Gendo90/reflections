When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You could use a remote repository to access your files from other computers, like if you were changing or upgrading computers and still
needed access to files. You could also access the files when travelling or from work and from home, if you want to have 24-hour access 
to files that are on a work computer. You could also use a remote repository to collaborate with others on a project, possibly never 
even meeting them in person and just seeing their updates to the code base! This would also work well with employees located in 
different offices who all work on the same project, like if you had a company that hired temporary workers, contractors, etc., or 
even was just a larger company with people with different specialties in different locations.
